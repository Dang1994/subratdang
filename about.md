## About

Subrat Kumar Dang is a doctoral researcher in the **Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department (MIED), Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee**, under the supervision of **Dr. Vidit Gaur**. His work focuses on the development of **advanced artificial intelligence methodologies for materials discovery**, with particular emphasis on integrating **physics-informed learning**, **large-scale multimodal models**, and **agentic AI frameworks** to support the design and analysis of high-performance materials.

His research is motivated by the need for computational approaches capable of systematically exploring complex design spaces, improving predictive reliability, and enabling accelerated decision-making in materials engineering. He is particularly interested in methods that unify data-driven modeling with materials domain knowledge to produce interpretable and scientifically grounded outcomes.

Prior to joining IIT Roorkee, he contributed to research and development activities at the **Bremen Institute for Production and Logistics (BIBA), University of Bremen**, where he worked on international and national projects in digital manufacturing and intelligent systems. His previous training includes an **M.Tech in Mechanical Engineering** from **SLIET, India**.

Subrat intends to pursue an academic career and is committed to conducting rigorous research, mentoring students, and contributing to the advancement of computational and AI-driven approaches in materials science.
