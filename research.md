## Research


My work is at the intersection of Machine Learning and Materials Science. Main areas:


- **AI-driven Materials Discovery** — Surrogate models + active learning for accelerated screening.
- **Physics-informed ML** — Incorporating physical constraints & PDEs into networks (PINNs).
- **Microstructure & Superalloys** — GNNs and image-based models for microstructure-property mapping.
