  <h2>Research Summary</h2>

  <p class="lead">
    My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and materials science. I develop computational methods that combine data-driven models with domain knowledge to accelerate the discovery, characterization, and design of high-performance materials.

  <h3 style="margin-top:22px;">Methods & Tools</h3>
  <p>
    I work with Python (PyTorch, JAX), graph neural networks, PINNs, active learning, Bayesian optimization, and experiment-simulation coupling. I emphasize reproducible workflows, open-source tooling, and interpretable model outputs suitable for collaboration with experimental labs.
